# summer-activities-fe

This is my list of summer activities. I want to be able to add activities with the family member who came up with the idea attached(creator). My main feature is to be able to randomly pull one activity and show it, almost like pulling a paper out of a hat.

This was created using a little HTML and a lot of Javascript with a Rails API backend.
